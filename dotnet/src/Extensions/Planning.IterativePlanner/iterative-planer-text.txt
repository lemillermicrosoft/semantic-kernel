Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:
{{$toolDescriptions}}

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {{$toolNames}}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}
```

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)

If you find the final answer, as tool name use exact text :"Final Answer" and in the action_input put the answer. Format the number in nice human readable way.

IMOPRTANT REMINDER: your each response should contain only one next step and only single one $JSON_BLOB. Do not provide more than one step.
