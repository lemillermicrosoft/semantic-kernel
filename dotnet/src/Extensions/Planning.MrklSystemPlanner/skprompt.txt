Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following functions:
[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]
{{$functionDescriptions}}
[END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

Use functions by specifying json for an Action.
The json should have an `action` key (with the name of the function to use) and `action_variables` key (with a dictionary of variables to use in the function).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are the [NAME] of functions in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].

The `action_variables` value should always have at least an `input` key even if the input value is empty.

The only other keys that should be in the "action_variables" value are the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" field in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].

Dictionary values in the "action_variables" field must be string type and should be the actual values to be passed to the function.

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
{
  "action": "NAME",
  "action_variables": {"INPUT": "some input", "PARAMETER_NAME": "some value"}
}

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: $JSON_BLOB
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Final Answer:

If you think of an Action to take, return the Action.

If you find the final answer, return it. Format the answer in nice human readable way.

IMOPRTANT REMINDER: your response should contain only one Thought and only single one Action $JSON_BLOB. Do not provide more than one step.
