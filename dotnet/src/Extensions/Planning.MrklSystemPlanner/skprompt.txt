Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following functions:
{{$functionDescriptions}}

Use functions by specifying json for an Action.
The json should have an `action` key (with the name of the function to use), an `action_input` key (with the input to the function going here), and an `action_variables` key (with a dictionary of variables to use in the function). The `action_variables` key is optional.

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {{$functionNames}}

The only values that should be in the "action_variables" field are the parameters of target "action".

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
{
  "action": $FUNCTION_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT,
  "action_variables": {"$VARIABLE_NAME": $VARIABLE_VALUE}
}

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: $JSON_BLOB
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Final Answer:

If you find the final answer, return it. Format the answer in nice human readable way.

IMOPRTANT REMINDER: your each response should contain only one next step and only single one $JSON_BLOB. Do not provide more than one step.
